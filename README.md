# Final Project Data Analytics
Bike Rentals 

This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization.


## 1. File Structures
```
.
├── Dashboard
│   ├── dashboard1.py
│   ├── logo bike rentals.png
│   └── day.csv
├── data
│   ├── Readme.txt
│   ├── day.csv
|   └── hour.csv
├── README.md
├── notebook(2).ipynb
└── requirements.txt
```

## 2. Project work cycle
1. Data Wrangling: 
 - Gathering data
 - Assessing data
 - Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
 - Defined business questions for data exploration
 - Create Data exploration
3. Data Visualization:
 - Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
4. Dashboard:
 - Set up the DataFrame which will be used
 - Make filter components on the dashboard
 - Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

**Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.**

## 3. Getting Started
### `notebook(2).ipynb`
1. Download this project.
2. Open Google Colab.
3. Create a New Notebook.
4. Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
5. Connect to hosted runtime.
6. Lastly, run the code cells.

### `Dashboard/dashboard1.py`
1. Download this project.
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Then, Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard1.py`.
